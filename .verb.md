# Getting started with toolkit

> Toolkit makes humans scalable

## What is toolkit?

Toolkit is a suite of open-source developer tools for initializing, configuring, building, documenting and maintaining code projects. 

## Why should I use toolkit?

**Highly decoupled, consistent API**

All of the applications in the toolkit suite are completely standalone and can be used without knowledge of the other applications. This means you can pick and choose which applications, tools or frameworks you want to use. 

**Learn one, learn them all**

Moreover, all of the applications share the same core API, so by learning any one of the applications, you will know how to begin using all of them.

**Create applications**

Whether you're creating a web server with [express][] or [koa][], a web application using [react][], [ember][] or [angular][], or your own build system, `toolkit` has tools that can be used to expedite the process.

## What does toolkit do?

Tookit applications are organized into the following categories:

1. [building blocks](#building-blocks)
1. [configuration](#configuration) 
1. [lifecycle](#lifecycle)
1. [automation](#automation) 

_(Any of the tools in the `toolkit` suite may be used standalone, but they work even better together.)_


### Building blocks

These "building blocks" are used as as starting point, providing an "instant API" for your node.js application:

- [base][]: Bare-bones starting point for creating a high quality node.js application. Build out your API by using plugins like building blocks. All of other the applications in the toolkit suite were created using Base.
- [templates][]: System for creating and managing template collections, and rendering templates with any node.js template engine. Can be used as the basis for creating a static site generator, blog framework, documentaton system, and so on.


### Configuration

Tools and conventions for defining, using and publishing declarative configurations for projects, components and templates.

- [boilerplate][]: Describes all of the necessary files, templates and settings required to initialize a complete, new project.
- [scaffold][]: Describes all of the necessary files, templates and settings required to initialize a complete, new project.
- [snippet][]: Tools and conventions for creating, using and publishing invidual snippets of code or text.

**Why is this useful?**

By keeping a separation of concerns between configuration and everything else (application logic, flow control, etc), we can use _plain, generic javascript, with prescriptive conventions to describe commonly needed objects, files, templates, and assets_. 

As a result, projects are lower complexity, easier to maintain, and the objects can be passed around to any rendering engine, build system, scaffolding tool or project generator when its time to create or build something.


### Lifecycle

Developer frameworks and command line tools for common phases of the software development lifecycle. 

- [generate][]: scaffold out new projects
- [assemble][]: build projects
- [verb][]: document projects


### Automation

These tools can be used during and throughout any point of the software development lifecycle to automate notifications, updates, and statuses, as well as conversions and interactions with users.

- [enquirer][]: Plugin-based prompt system, to automate interactions and conversations with users.
- [microbot][]: Empower your applications and users with automated responses, actions and notifications.
- [update][]: Automate boring and time consuming chores that are typically done manually, for virtually any aspect of a project.
