# Getting started with toolkit

## What is toolkit?

Toolkit is a suite of open-source developer tools for initializing, configuring, building, documenting and maintaining code projects. 

## Why should I use toolkit?

**Highly decoupled, consistent API**

All of the applications in the toolkit suite are completely standalone and can be used without knowledge of the other applications. This means you can pick and choose which applications, tools or frameworks you want to use. 

**Learn one, learn them all**

Moreover, all of the applications share the same core API, so by learning any one of the applications, you will know how to begin using all of them.

**Create applications**

Whether you're creating a web server with [express][] or [koa][], a web application using [react][], [ember][] or [angular][], or your own build system, toolkit has frameworks and tools that can be used to expedite the process.

## What does toolkit do?

Tookit applications are organized into the following categories:

1. [building blocks](#building-blocks)
1. [lifecycle](#lifecycle)
1. [configuration](#configuration) 


### Building blocks

Create an "instant API" for your node.js application. These "building blocks" are used as 

* [base][]: Bare-bones starting point for creating a high quality node.js application. Build out your API by using plugins like building blocks. All of other the applications in the toolkit suite were created using Base.
* [templates][]: System for creating and managing template collections, and rendering templates with any node.js template engine. Can be used as the basis for creating a static site generator, blog framework, documentaton system, and so on.

### Lifecycle

Developer frameworks and command line tools that address common phases of the software development lifecycle. Each of these tools can be used standalone, but they work even better together.

**Tools**

1. [generate][]: create projects
1. [assemble][]: build projects
1. [verb][]: document projects
1. [update][]: maintain projects


### Configuration

Tools and conventions for defining, using and publishing declarative configurations for projects, components and templates.

**Tools**

* [boilerplate][]: Describes all of the necessary files, templates and settings required to initialize a complete, new project.
* [scaffold][]: Describes all of the necessary files, templates and settings required to initialize a complete, new project.
* [snippet][]: Tools and conventions for creating, using and publishing invidual snippets of code or text.

**Advantages**

By keeping a separation of concerns between configuration and everything else (application logic, flow control, etc), we can use plain, generic javascript, with prescriptive conventions to describe commonly needed objects, files, templates, and assets. 

As a result, projects are lower complexity, easier to maintain, and the objects can be passed around to any rendering engine, build system or project generator when its time to create something.
