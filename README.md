# Getting started with toolkit

## What is toolkit?

Toolkit is a suite of open-source developer tools for initializing, configuring, building, documenting and maintaining code projects.

All of the applications in the toolkit suite are completely standalone and can be used without knowledge of the other applications. However, all of the applications share the same core API, so by learning any one of the applications, you will know how to begin using all of them.

## Suite

Tookit applications are organized into the following categories:

1. [building blocks](#building-blocks)
2. [lifecycle](#lifecycle)
3. [configuration](#configuration)

### Building blocks

* [base](https://github.com/node-base/base): Bare-bones starting point for creating a high quality node.js application. Build out your API by using plugins like building blocks. All of other the applications in the toolkit suite were created using Base.
* [templates](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/templates): System for creating and managing template collections, and rendering templates with any node.js template engine. Can be used as the basis for creating a static site generator, blog framework, documentaton system, and so on.

### Lifecycle

Developer frameworks and command line tools for the major "stages" of the software development lifecycle:

1. [generate](https://github.com/generate/generate): create
2. [assemble](https://github.com/assemble/assemble): build
3. [verb](https://github.com/verbose/verb): document
4. [update](https://github.com/update/update): maintain

### Configuration

Tools and conventions for defining portable, re-usable, declarative configurations.
