## Render cycle

The "render cycle" describes the complete lifecycle of a view (or template), from the time it's created, to the time it's rendered, and all of the stages in between.

* [templates][]: The first and only node.js application to provide complete control over the entire "render cycle". System for creating and managing template collections and rendering templates with any node.js template engine. Can be used as the basis for creating a static site generator, blog framework, documentaton system, and more.
