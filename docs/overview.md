## Generate

CLI and API for scaffolding out new code projects. A more powerful, composable, functional alternative to Google's Yeoman.

**Under the hood**

At its core, generate is a system for registering, resolving and running generators. Generators themselves are an instance of `Generate`, so every generator can register, resolve or run other generators; and every generator can be registered on, resolved by, or run by other generators.

## Update

Update gives you a way to automate the maintenance of files that are typically excluded from the automated parts of the software lifecycle, and thus are mostly forgotten about after they're created.
